# Part 1

## Set 1
1.The bug never stay in its original position without moving. But it will stay in a constant patter of moving across the grid.  
2.And direction that its head is pointing at  
3.It rotates
4. Flowers
5. Rotates 90 degrees  
6. It will rotate 45 degrees checks to see if there is a rock and then rotates another 45 degrees and goes forward along that direction  
7.No
8. Changes color when bug steps on it and gradually turns darker as the bug moves away from it  
9.Rocks can move if you use the method move and also change color
10.No, bugs and flowers cannot be on the same grid, the bug creates a new flower and the bug will avoid rocks  

### Exercises   
1. 0 : North
   45: North East  
   90: East  
   135:South East  
   180:South  
   225:South West  
   270 :West
   315 :North west
   360:North  
2.You can move up down and side to side however, if the bug moves and is out of bounds or outside the grid, an error message will be thrown out.  
3.void setColor  
4.The bug disappeared from the screen    

# Part 2

## Set 2  

1.sideLength is the length of the box that BoxBug travels in  
2.steps tracks how many steps the boxbug moves so that it moves that specific amount  
3.It is called twice because it only turns the bug 45 degrees and in order to make a complete turn you must turn ninety degrees so the turn is called twice.  
4. Because the move function is inherited from the super class Bug.  
5.No you cannot change the square pattern as in there are no methods in which you change the variable sideLength so once the bug is constructed it cannot be changed!  
6. If there are obstacles in the path of the boxBug it will change its path.  
7.Once you turn twice.  

### Exercises  
1.  CircleBug is different because it only turns once instead of twice which makes it move in a circular path instead of a square.Other than that it is very similiar.
